/**
 * Increase the value of currency units by paying DWA
 * <p>
 * Parameters
 * <ul>
 * <li>currency - currency id
 * <li>amountPerUnitNQT - the NQT amount invested into increasing the value of a single currency unit.<br>
 * This value is multiplied by the currency total supply and the result is deducted from the sender's account balance.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Constraints
 * <p>
 * This API is allowed only when the currency is {@link dwa.CurrencyType#RESERVABLE} and is not yet active.
 * <p>
 * The sender account is registered as a founder. Once the currency becomes active
 * the total supply is distributed between the founders based on their proportional investment<br>
 * The list of founders and their NQT investment can be obtained using the {@link dwa.http.GetCurrencyFounders} API.
